## 4. Class Imbalance Analysis

The dataset is **significantly imbalanced** — only **32.1%** of all QA pairs are positive.

### Imbalance Groups

| Group | Clause Types | Positive Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Always present | Document Name, Parties | ~100% | Universal across all contracts |
| High presence | Agreement Date, Governing Law, Expiration Date, Effective Date, Anti-Assignment | 73–92% | Standard boilerplate clauses |
| Moderate presence | Cap On Liability, License Grant, Audit Rights | 42–54% | Common but not universal |
| Low presence | Termination For Convenience → Covenant Not To Sue | 20–36% | Deal-specific clauses |
| Rare | Rofr/Rofo/Rofn → Affiliate License-Licensee | 10–17% | Specialized provisions |
| Very rare | Joint Ip Ownership → Source Code Escrow | 2.5–9% | Niche/exceptional clauses |

### Key Imbalance Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Most imbalanced clause | Source Code Escrow (2.5% positive) |
| Least imbalanced clause | License Grant (50.0% positive — perfectly balanced) |
| Clauses with < 10% positive rate | 8 out of 41 (20%) |
| Clauses with > 50% positive rate | 8 out of 41 (20%) |
| Overall positive rate | 32.1% |
| Positive : Negative ratio | 1 : 2.12 |

### Implications for Modeling

- **Stratified sampling** is essential — naive random splits will under-represent rare clause types.
- **Weighted loss functions** (e.g., `BCEWithLogitsLoss` with `pos_weight`) are recommended, especially for the bottom 10 clause types.
- **Evaluation metrics** should prioritize **F1 / precision-recall** over accuracy — a model predicting "absent" for everything would achieve 67.9% accuracy but be useless.
- Clauses like `Source Code Escrow` (13 positives) and `Price Restrictions` (15 positives) may need **data augmentation** or few-shot approaches.
